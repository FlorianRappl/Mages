## Becoming a Contributor

Until the project has enough contributors a [BDFL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Benevolent_dictator_for_life) model is followed. As such the sole key maintainer keeps the right to appoint GitHub members as regular project contributors. Nevertheless, usually appointing someone follows this process:

1. An individual contributes actively via discussions (reporting bugs, giving feedback to existing or opening new issues) and / or pull requests
2. The individual is either directly asked, invited or asks for contributor rights on the project
3. The individual uses the contribution rights to sustain or increase the active contributions

Every contributor has to sign the contributor's license agreement (CLA) to establish a legal trust between the project and its contributors.
